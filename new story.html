        <h1>My Coding Journey: A Tale of Dedication and Success</h1>
        
        <p><strong><em>My name is Olena Barylova. I have escaped from Ukraine to the Netherlands because of the war in my country. One day, I stumbled upon a flyer for She Codes Workshops, a series of coding workshops designed to empower
        women in tech. Intrigued by the idea of learning something new, I decided to attend the workshops.
        With no prior experience in coding, I found myself at the very beginning of my coding journey. It was a challenging endeavor, but I knew that hard work and perseverance are the key to each success. My coding journey has been a challenging yet rewarding experience to delve into this entirely new
        field. I firmly believe that the only way to truly learn something is to dedicate myself to studying day by day.</strong></em></p>
        <p><em>Embarking on a new journey in life can be both daunting and exhilarating, especially when it involves
        stepping into an entirely new field of knowledge. As a 41-year-old busy lady originally from Ukraine, now living in
        Amsterdam, my coding journey began with the She Codes Workshops. This story aims to highlight the challenges and
        rewards of my coding experience and emphasize the importance of daily dedication in acquiring new skills.</em></p>

    <h2>The She Codes Workshops: A Gateway to New Possibilities</h2>
    When I first attended the She Codes Workshops, I had no prior
    experience or knowledge of coding. However, the workshops provided me with a supportive and inclusive learning
    environment, allowing me to start my journey from scratch. The structured curriculum, coupled with the guidance of
    experienced mentors, created the perfect foundation for my coding adventure.</p>
    <p>
    <h2>The Challenges</h2>
 <strong><em>A Stepping-Stone to Growth:</em></strong> Delving into a completely new field was not without its fair share of
challenges. The learning process was intense, and at times, I felt overwhelmed by the complexities of coding. However, I
firmly believe that it is through facing challenges head-on that we grow the most. Rather than getting discouraged by
setbacks, I embraced them as opportunities to learn and improve.</p>

    <p>
    <h2>Dedication: The Key to Mastery</h2>
    Throughout my coding journey, one valuable lesson I learned was the importance of
    dedication. As a busy lady with numerous responsibilities, finding time for studying was not always easy. However, I
    realized that true mastery could only be achieved through daily commitment. I made it a point to dedicate a specific
    time each day to coding, allowing me to progress steadily and retain what I had learned.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Reward and Fulfillment</h2>
    The rewards of my coding journey have been immeasurable. As I delved deeper into the world of
    coding, I began to understand the beauty of problem-solving and the power of creating something from scratch. Each small
    victory brought a sense of fulfillment and motivation to continue my journey.</p>

            challenges I face</small></div>
        </p>
    
         <p>
    <h2>Expanding Horizons</h2>
    <strong><em>Discovering New Possibilities:</em></strong> Beyond the personal growth and satisfaction, coding has opened up a
    world of possibilities for me. I now have the ability to create websites, develop applications, and contribute to the
    tech community. The skills I gained have not only boosted my professional prospects but have also enhanced my overall
    understanding of the digital era we live in.</p>

    <p></p><h2><em>Conclusion:</em></h2> 
    <em>My coding journey has been a testament to the power of dedication and perseverance. By joining the She Codes
    Workshops and immersing myself in the world of coding, I have achieved not only personal growth but also gained
    invaluable skills that have widened my horizons. I encourage anyone who is considering venturing into coding to embrace
    the challenges, dedicate themselves to continuous learning, and embark on this rewarding journey. Remember, the only way
    to truly learn something is to dive deep and study day by day</em></p>
