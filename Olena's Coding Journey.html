  <h1>Olena's Coding Journey</h1>
  <p>Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Amsterdam, there lived a busy lady named Olena. She was a 41-year-old
    refugee from Ukraine, seeking a fresh start in her new home.</p>
  <p>One day, Olena stumbled upon a flyer for She Codes Workshops, a series of coding workshops designed to empower
    women in tech. Intrigued by the idea of learning something new, Olena decided to attend the workshops.</p>
  <p>With no prior experience in coding, Olena found herself at the very beginning of her coding journey. It was a
    challenging endeavor, but she knew that hard work and perseverance were key to her success.</p>
  <p>Day by day, Olena immersed herself in studying this new field. She spent countless hours in front of her computer,
    tirelessly learning and practicing her coding skills.</p>

  <p>Throughout her journey, Olena faced both triumphs and obstacles. There were moments of frustration and exhaustion,
    but she never lost sight of her goal.</p>

  <p>Whenever Olena felt overwhelmed, she would take a break and enjoy a comforting cup of tea. It served as a reminder
    that she had a strong support system and the determination to continue her coding journey.</p>

  <p>Slowly but surely, Olena's coding skills began to flourish. She started building her own projects, solving complex
    problems, and achieving milestones she once thought were impossible.</p>
  <p>And so, Olena's touchy and lively story of perseverance, determination, and the pursuit of knowledge goes on. She
    knows that through coding, she can shape her own future and make a difference in the world.</p>
